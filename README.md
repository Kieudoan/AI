This project collected waste image data from various sources on Kaggle and labeled objects into categories: Plastic, Cardboard, Metal, Paper, and Glass. All images were then split into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 70%, 20%, and 10%, respectively. The YOLOv5 algorithm was used, with hyperparameters adjusted appropriately to initiate the training process on Google Colab. The average evaluation metrics on the test set showed promising results, with a precision of 0.876 and a recall of 0.857.
